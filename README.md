This project focuses on building a recommendation system with image processing. 

(1) classify an image when a new product picture comes into the system, and give it a category. <br>
(2) Use the classified category for image retrieval, so we won't compute similarities for all images in our system, which is computationally expensive. <br>
(3) Recommend product based on image similarities.
